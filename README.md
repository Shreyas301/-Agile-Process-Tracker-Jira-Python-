# -Agile-Process-Tracker-Jira-Python-
Built a Python tool integrating with the Jira API to track Agile metrics like sprint progress, velocity, and issue status. Automated reporting and visual dashboards helped identify bottlenecks and improve team efficiency. Used JQL, Pandas, and Plotly for data handling and visualization.
